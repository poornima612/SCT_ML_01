## 📂 Files Included

- `house_prices_sample_v2.csv` — Sample dataset with 50 rows of simulated house data.
- `task-1.py` — Python script that trains a linear regression model and evaluates it.

## 🧠 ML Model Overview

We use **scikit-learn's LinearRegression** to train a model on the following features:
- `square_feet`
- `bedrooms`
- `bathrooms`

The target variable is:
- `price`
